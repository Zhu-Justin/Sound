$D = A_{t} - B_{t} \sim N(\mu, \sigma_{t}^{2})$ where $\sigma^{2}_{t} = \sqrt{t} \sigma^{2},$ where $\sigma^{2}$ is fitted from prior data

$P(D > 0) = \Phi\left(\frac{ D - \mu }{ \sigma_{t}^{2} } \right)$

2:1 odds for A winning

$n \times p$ matrix where $n = number of games$  and $p = D_{Q1}, D_{Q2}, D_{Q3}, D_{Q4}, Home Team, Result$

-   Using Trained Data
-   Online Learning (as data is being collected)

$O(np \log np)$

1.  Github base engine-pricing model
2.  Branched this Brownian motion pricing model into the main github repo
3.  Code review + pull request
4.  Jira Atlassian, scrum + standup

Takeaways

1.  Parallelize jobs early
2.  Classes

Improvements

1.  Rust
2.  General Productivity: after lunch (have a small lunch, keep it simple), try to get most of work done first in the morning

Day-to-Day

1.  Learning new things, applying it into projects, creating something cool to share
2.  Open-source projects and general research
3.  Building tools for quantitative research (statistical computing + inference for learning)
